* Zero test case maintainability
* Clean teardown
* Advanced assertion api
* Advance rules
* Keep Logs of every action performed on server 
* Highly configurable reporting
* Easy deployable and ready to run regression
* Capable of stopping and starting components at every test run
* clean component

### Need support using this tool in your org
Don't hesitate to write me a mail at (mrpjpandey@gmail.com with topic need Help) and I will help you for free.

## See it in action in a Sample App
While this guide explains the *what*, *why* and *how*, I find it helpful to see them in practice. This tool is accompanied by a sample application that follows basic usage . You can find the [sample application (named exampleApp) here](https://github.com/Priytam/auto/tree/master/exampleApp) in the `modular` folder. Feel free to grab it, clone it, or fork it. [Instructions on running it are in its readme](https://github.com/Priytam/auto/blob/master/exampleApp/readme.md).

## Contribution is always welcome
